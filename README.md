### Overview

`dataset-tools` is a modular utility toolkit for managing datasets in machine learning and AI applications. It simplifies common tasks such as:

- Converting labels between formats (e.g., YOLO TXT, XML, etc.).
- Visualizing bounding boxes on images from annotation files.
- Splitting datasets into training, validation, and testing sets.
- Renaming and organizing dataset files.

`Tech` used in this repository:
- `isort` and `black` keep the code consistent and clean.
- `OpenCV` handles computer vision tasks.
